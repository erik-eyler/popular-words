## MVP

- A date range search bar

- A word search bar

- Output box that gives the most popular words for the user generated date range from the Guardian's archive with the number of times used

- Minimal HTML and CSS

---

## Post-MVP

- Word bubble stylized output box for the words generated that makes the words bigger based on how often they were used

- Replicating the entire search bar + output box to allow the user to compare multiple searches across the keyword and date range search bars.

- More stylized CSS
